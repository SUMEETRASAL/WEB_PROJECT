                <center><h2>Karuna Reiki® Master</h2></center>
                <h3>Class Fee : ₹ 10,800/-</h3>
                <h4>Pre-requisites : You must have been a Reiki master for at least 6 months and be able to draw the Reiki II and Master symbols from memory</h4>

                <p>This class is for anyone who has had Reiki Master training. It is complete with two levels, two attunements, four master symbols and eight treatment symbols. We have experimented with and taught this system since 1994 and have found it to be effective and powerful. In fact, most students find it more powerful than Usui Reiki! The energy has a more definite feeling to it. It works on the emotional and spiritual levels and also can help one become more grounded. Those who receive the attunements report experiences with their guides, angels, and higher self and feel the healing presence of other enlightened beings.

                    <br><br> A brief description of the four Karuna Reiki® I symbols is given here: The first symbol prepares the client for deep healing and is useful with past life issues. It helps release karma and deeply seated issues on the cellular level. The second symbol heals deeply and can be used to breakup the negative patterns we unconsciously use to insulate ourselves from the truth, thus shattering delusion and denial. It heals the shadow self. The third symbol fills the person with love and restores balance. The fourth symbol completes the treatment by bringing the client back into the body and grounding. The Karuna II symbols are of a higher vibration and more powerful. They help connect directly with the Higher Self and work on a deeper level. While they have specific purposes discussed in class, the experience of their energy allows intuitive guidance in their use.
                    
                    <br><br>Both levels of Karuna Reiki® and both attunements will be given as well as instruction and practice on the use of all twelve symbols. You will be able to teach all four levels of Karuna Reiki®, two practitioner levels and two master levels after taking this class.
                    
                    <br><br>Lots of practice time is included for giving treatments, using the symbols and for learning the attunement processes.
                    
                    <br><br>We will also be doing a Reiki meditation to be aware of and heal the Shadow Self and using chanting and toning with Karuna Reiki®.</p>
                    <h4>*Please note that this master training is not licensed or related to International Center for Reiki Training in any way. The Student will receive a certificate and manual issued by Sumeet Rasal, Reiki Master Teacher</h4>
